# About the Project

In 2019, the antivirus provider, Norton, reported 3800 publicly disclosed breaches exposing over 4.1 billion records (records are like rows of data)

Wouldn't you want to know if you were part of the 4.1 billion records? What if someone misuses your personal information against you? In modern days, online security is just as important as locking your front door. 

Hack Check provides a service enabling you to check where and when your information was exposed. 

## The Email Search Feature
Type your email id and we will check wherever your email id shows within dumps of leaks. Once a match has been found, we will display additional information that can help you secure your account. 

The additional information contains the number of accounts leaked in that breach, the date this breach occurred, what was leaked, and a story. 

## Password Generator 
Generate a random password based on the parameters you set.

By using our service, you can prevent your accounts from being misused. How? When a hacker hacks a service, they dump the data online for others to use. These hackers will buy and use your information (say email id and password on your favourite website), and they will try it against other popular services in hopes that you've used the same password or information. "Leaks" is a term that refers to data made public that otherwise should remain private, and a "hack" is when a user (a hacker) gets unauthorized access to a system.
